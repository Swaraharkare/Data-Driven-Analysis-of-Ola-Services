# 🚖 OLA Multi-Tool Data Analytics Project
###**📌 Project Overview**###

This project is an end-to-end analysis of OLA’s ride-hailing operations. It demonstrates a multi-tool approach to data analytics, utilizing SQL for data extraction, Excel for initial profiling, Python for deep-dive statistical analysis, and Power BI for executive-level dashboards.
The goal is to analyze 76k+ ride records from July 2024 to optimize booking success rates and maximize revenue across different vehicle categories.

###**🛠️ Multi-Tool Tech Stack**###
Tool	Purpose	Key Task
SQL	:Data Extraction & Querying	Identifying Top 5 customers, calculating cancellation rates, and analyzing reasons.
Excel:	Data Cleaning & ETL	Handling "null" values, formatting dates, and initial data profiling.
Python:	Statistical Analysis	Using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for correlation & distribution analysis.
Power BI:	BI Dashboarding	Creating interactive visualizations for C-suite stakeholders based on KPIs.

📊 Project Workflow & Key Queries
1. SQL (The Foundation)
I used SQL to answer critical business questions directly from the database:
Revenue Analysis: Identifying top-performing locations and average booking values.
Cancellation Rates: Calculating % Cancellation Rate by vehicle type using CASE statements and GROUP BY.
KPI Tracking: Finding MAX/MIN driver ratings and COUNT of bookings per hour.
Customer Loyalty: Identifying the TOP 5 customers by ride count.

SELECT Vehicle_Type, 
       ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN Booking_Status <> 'Success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)),2) AS Cancellation_Rate_Percent
FROM OlaBooking GROUP BY Vehicle_Type ORDER BY Cancellation_Rate_Percent DESC;

2. Python (The Deep Dive)
Using Pandas and Matplotlib, I developed several visualizations in a Jupyter Notebook:
Hourly Demand Pattern: Identifying peak hours (8 AM, 6 PM) for surge pricing strategies.
Ride Status Distribution: A 360-degree view of successful vs. failed bookings.
TAT Analysis: Comparing Vehicle Arrival Time vs. Customer Readiness time.

4. Power BI (The Dashboard)
An interactive dashboard was developed to monitor live metrics:
Overall Executive Summary: Total Bookings (76K), 50% cancellation rate observed.
Cancellation Insights: Visualizing the primary customer reason ("Driver is not moving...") and driver reason ("Personal/Car issue").
Vehicle Type View: High volume in Mini/Bike, highest value in Prime SUV

🚀 Key Business Insights (2026)
Operational Bottleneck: The primary issue is the high total cancellation volume (39K of 76K bookings).
Efficiency Issue: Average Vehicle TAT (82.90s) is nearly double the Average Customer TAT (41.26s), indicating drivers are slow to arrive after accepting a ride.
Actionable Insight: The "Driver is not moving" customer complaint directly links to the slow V_TAT. OLA should implement real-time geo-fencing to penalize stationary drivers post-acceptance.
